Changelog
=========

Version 1.5 (UNRELEASED)
-----------

* Added paragraph about old style Zope 2 Product installation in the
  INSTALL.txt_tmpl file of the plone template.
  Will be added to the installation instructions if the top level namespace
  package is called 'Products'.
  [davconvent]

Version 1.4
-----------

* Set the version number for plone.recipe.plone in a new versions part in
  buildout.cfg. That works around a buildout bug: buildout breaks if you change
  the revision pin for a recipe.
  [wichert]

* Fixed bug: when running 'paster create' with --no-interactive option, 
  the package variable given in the command line is ignored.
