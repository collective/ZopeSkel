    [hannosch]

2.6 - July 15, 2008

-------------------

* Hosting template:

  - fix test for Varnish-support in the supervisord configuration.
    [wichert]

    having to break invocations.
    [wichert]

2.4 - July 9, 2008
------------------

* Restore the cwd after running buildout in the hosting recipe so further
  processing works correctly.
  [wichert]

  or show it at a later point.
  [wichert]

  [wichert]

* Added kss plugin template
  [gotcha, jfroche, adrien01]

2.3 - June 24, 2008
-------------------

* Fix problem in the hosting template: varnish was always enabled
  even if not desired.
  [wichert]

* Added ZopeSkel test layer with the apropriate testSetup and testTearDown.
  The steps in the top of each test file is not anymore needed: delete 
  tempdir/plone.example and then cd to tempdir.
  [mustapha]

* Make the zope2product option in the archetype template default to true.
  [mustapha]

* Modified buildout.cf to only test zopeskel.
  [mustapha]

* Fixed the paster test function: overwrite option should default to True for
  the create command.
  [mustapha]

* Added ``use_local_commands`` attribute (a la use_cheetah). A zopeskel
  template that wants to use local commands has to set it to True .
  [mustapha]

* Get rid of zopeskel.txt and use setup.cfg to store the parent template name.
  [mustapha]

* Sub-templates may define a parent_template attribute with the list of 
  templates that can use it.

  [mustapha]

Version 2.2
-----------

* Install Plone 3.1.2 by default.
  [wichert]

* Remove useless spans from the portlet template.
  [wichert]

* Add supervisorctl configuration.
  [wichert]


Version 2.1
-----------

* Revert BaseTemplate usage from the hosting template (changeset
  57368 from Tarek). It was not used and broke the buildout. This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/8
  [wichert]

* Replace the generic README in the plone_hosting template with documentation
  that is important for deployments. 
  [wichert]

* Add log rotation support to the hosting buildout. Merged from Jarn's
  bones package.
  [wichert]


Version 2.0
-----------

* Switch plone_hosting template to using supervisord to manage processes.
  Merged from Jarn's bones package.
  [wichert]

* Reduced the number of questions to generate an atschema and used 
  the MessageFactory instead of declaring an i18n_domain attribute
  [mustapha]

* Fixed missing imports in plone2_theme
  [mustapha]

* Removed unused imports in plone_pas
  [mustapha]

* In plone2.5_theme: when the skinname is empty, replace it with a
  default text, otherwise adding a Plone Site will throw an error when
  displaying the extension profiles.
  [maurits]

* Added note to profiles.zcml of plone2.5_theme that
  five.registerPackage needs Five version 1.4.
  [maurits]

* Added a BUILDBOT.txt file.
  [tarek]

* plone3_portlet: added commented out alternative AddForm for when
  there are no configurable parameters.  That was shorter than listing
  all the changes (where we forgot one).
  [maurits]

* Fixed typos in archetyps and plone3 portlets: 'portletBotomLeft'
  should have been 'portletBottomLeft' with two 't's.
  [maurits]

* Made plone3_portlet respect pep8 (and pyflakes).
  [maurits]

* Use 1.0 as default version number for all templates. This is a more sensible
  default than 0.1 since we start of with dev-versions anyway.
  [wichert]

* sub-templates per ZopeSkel template: Only sub-templates related to the parent
  template is visible with the -l option
  [mustapha]

* added -a (--list-all) option to show all subtemplates regardless of the
  current project. Subtemplates that are not for the type of the current
  project are prefixed with N
  [mustapha]

* Fixed the recreation of the paster_plugins.txt metadata file for archetype.
  For now we have to run 2 times the egg_info command to get the paster_plugins
  file recreated (setuptools problem: nice task to fix) 
  [mustapha]

* fixed the case of many inner packages: ask the user to choose a packe to
  inject content into if the command is run outside of an inner package
  [mustapha]

* make all ZopeSkel templates that inherits from BaseTemplate addcontent aware
  [mustapha]

* Added plone_pas template for PlonePas projects and many subtemplates
  [mustapha]

* regrouped archetype subtemplates in templates/archetype
  [mustapha]

* added and fixed tests
  [mustapha]


Version 1.10
------------

* Install Plone 3.1.1 as default option.
  [wichert]
  
* Fixed a problem with ZopeSkel localcommands when we have multiple 
  projects, it was getting the first directory always and sometimes
  the package dir was not the first directory, so when running the
  addcontent in the package it was creating the contents in the wrong
  dir. Thanks to wichert for pointing me this file.
  [dsa]  

* Update the hosting template to make running of buildout optional.
  [wichert]

* Update the hosting template to test if a port is already in use and
  abort if so.
  [wichert]

* Update the hosting template to only ask for a single base port number.
  [wichert]

* Fix broken creation of Plone 3.1(.x) sites.
  [wichert]


Version 1.9
-----------

* Install Plone 3.1 as default option.
  [wichert]

* Fixed a missing 'import os' in the plone2_theme template. [davisagli]

* Fix an ambiguous question in the silva_buildout template, and update
  the generated README file. [thefunny]


Version 1.8 
-----------

* fixed the recipe template buildout.cfg generation, thanks Kai ;)
  [tarek]

Version 1.7
-----------

* Update the templates to have README.txt and HISTORY.txt in valid
  restructured format and use those as the package's long description.
  This automatically gives packages a more readable page on PyPI
  (and PSC with Tarek's excellent changes).
  [wichert]

* Adjust the trove classifiers on the packages to not claim incorrect
  frameworks: we should only claim frameworks on which the package
  can run directly. So, for example, do not claim Zope2 of we also need
  Plone on top of Zope2.
  [wichert]
  

Version 1.6
-----------

* Add templates for a Silva buildout.
  [thefunny]

* Add a metadata.xml to all generated GenericSetup profiles. This is
  required by new versions of GenericSetup.
  [wichert]

* For nested namespace packages we need to declare both namespace
  levels as namespace packages. This is a requirement for current
  versions of setuptools.
  [wichert]

* Use Plone 3.0.6 as default version for new Plone hosting buildouts
  [wichert]


Version 1.5.1
-------------

* Fix #2 (missing import in 'hosting.py') at
  http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/2
  [nouri]

Version 1.5
-----------

* added a new local command into archetype template to inject
  new content types [spanky] 

* added a doctest for each template, and refactored the package
  so we have one python module per template [tarek] 

* Refactored the zc.buildout recipe to provide structured documention
  that will render nicely on PyPI, added comments for recipe authors
  to help writing documentation and tests and added a working doctest
  skeleton. Implemented automatic license classifiers for common
  licenses in the generated setup.py. The mapping is in zopeskel.base
  and can be used for other templates also.
  [dokai]

* The 'five:registerPackage' ZCML directive is added in a project based on the
  'plone' template only if the top level namespace package is not
  called 'Products'. This avoids having the product loaded twice in Zope.
  [davconvent]

* Added paragraph about old style Zope 2 Product installation in the
  INSTALL.txt_tmpl file of the plone template.
  The paragraph will be added to the installation instructions if the top
  level namespace package is called 'Products'.
  [davconvent]

Version 1.4
-----------

* Set the version number for plone.recipe.plone in a new versions part in
  buildout.cfg. That works around a buildout bug: buildout breaks if you change
  the revision pin for a recipe.
  [wichert]

* Fixed bug: when running 'paster create' with --no-interactive option, 
  the package variable given in the command line is ignored.
  [Mustapha]

Version 1.3.4
-------------

* Added MANIFEST.in to prevent bad releases from svn exports.
  [fschulze]

Version 1.3.3
-------------

* Move to the newly released Varnish 1.1.2.
  [wichert]

* Remove bad import which broke localcommand support.
  [deo]

* Remove unneeded imports and whitespace cleanup.
  [deo]

Version 1.3.2
-------------

* Small fix in plone3_theme that did not install correctly with easy_install
  because of some files missing the the egg informations (added MANIFEST.in).
  [davconvent]

Version 1.3.1
-------------

* Added 'addcontent' local command to make possible injecting content types 
  in ZopeSkel projects and make the Archetype template 'addcontent' aware.
  [mustapha]

* Updated to Plone 3.0.4.
  [fschulze]

* Rerelease because of a bad egg.
  [fschulze]

Version 1.3
-----------

* added the `recipe` template
  [tarek]

* Add Plone 2.5.5.
  [wichert]

Version 1.2
-----------

* Merge a slightly stripped down version of the Jarn Plone hosting template.
  This provides a convenient way to create a buildout for all Plone 2.5 and
  3.0 versions with ZEO and optional Varnish based caching.
  [wichert]
