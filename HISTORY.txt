Changelog
=========

2.12 - Unreleased
-----------------

* Declare a dependency on elementtree.  It's not a direct dependency
  of ZopeSkel, but ZopeSkel depends on Cheetah which depends on
  Markdown, which has an install-time dependency on elementtree but
  doesn't declare that.
  [davisagli]

* remove the custom `egg_info.writer` and keywords for `paster_plugins`
  since this has been an entry point of PasteScript since 1.6.3, using
  the `setup_requires` as per the change log found here:
  http://pythonpaste.org/script/news.html#id4
  
  This solves an issue where the distutils would go into an infinite
  loop when you add a new `install_requires` package
  [claytron]

* plone3_theme: made the generated viewlet.pt not crash when the
  accompanying view has not been changed so has no computed_value.
  Added some inline documentation there and fixed example
  registration.  [maurits]

* In the plone3_theme say that we are creating a theme for Plone 3,
  not specifically for 3.0.
  [maurits]

* In the plone template fix the generated INSTALL.txt: when telling
  users to add $project to the eggs, the example snippet should indeed
  add $project and not the $full_package_name.
  [maurits]

* In the plone_app and plone3_portlet templates use the full package
  name instead of the project name in zcml lines in the generated
  INSTALL.txt.  The project/package/egg name may be 'silly' when the
  package structure is far/better/name, which means the zcml needs to
  be 'far.better.name'.  Thanks to Espen Moe-Nilssen for spotting this.
  [maurits]

* Make the Plone 3 buildout default to Plone 3.2.2.
  [maurits]

* Removed the setup.cfg from all templates. It makes the common operation of
  tagging and releasing packages harder with little benefit. It can be easily
  added by those who know about this particular feature.
  [hannosch]

* Removed the useless `Python Modules` trove classifier from all templates.
  [hannosch]

2.11 - February, 5th
--------------------

* Make the Plone 3 buildout default to Plone 3.2.1, and pick up 
  ${versions:zope2-url} for Plone > 3.1
  [MatthewWilkes]

* added a version requirement for Cheetah (>1.0)
  [tarek]

* fix zopeskel/docs/localcommands.txt
  [yboussard]

* Modify zopeskel/templates/plone/+namespace_package+/+package+/tests.py_tmpl
  to init egg as product if it is a Zope2 product.
  [yboussard]

* Modify plone3_buildout template to ask for a Plone version. If the version
  is 3.0 or 3.1 it uses the plone install recipe, otherwise it uses the Plone
  egg from the cheeseshop.
  [MatthewWilkes]

* Link to appropriate PyPI pages for recipes used.
  [MatthewWilkes]

* Add a Zope 2 without Plone buildout template.
  [evilbungle]

* Reconciling HISTORY.txt to mirror what can be found at the following:
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZopeSkel/2.10. Release of 2.10 was clobbered
  due to what looks like a merge at r74790.
  [andrewb]

* Update plone2.5_template's buildout.cfg_tmpl to use Zope 2.9.10. This
  release incorporates Hotfix-2008-08-12. Defaulting to a known insecure
  Zope seems unwise for people that may be updating legacy environments into
  buildout, since they're likely to forget to include the hotfix. Url to
  2.9.10 hard-coded (as opposed to the more elegantly self-aware
  plone.recipe.plone approach) per the practice of a plone.recipe.distros
  plone part.
  [andrewb]

* Nearly at the end of the creation of a ZopeSkel template, the local
  commands available for that template are displayed.
  [jaraco, markvl]

* The Plone template now has local commands. (Basically moved them
  from the archetype templates to plone templates and made them
  available for both.
  [markvl]

* Added base test setup to the archetype template. Added wiring code that
  runs README.txt as a doctest.
  [esartor]

* Added tests to the addcontent contenttype command. These ammend the
  README.txt file for each content type providing basic tests for creating,
  editing and removing instances of the added content type.
  [esartor]


2.10 - September, 17th
----------------------

* Fixed a small bug that made most templates create a package that was
* showing twice in the Plone quick
  installer is the top level namespace package was called 'Products'. Bug
  was fixed in the 'plone' template (since version 1.5), now in other ones
  where needed too.
  [davconvent]


2.9 - September, 1st
--------------------

* Update silva buildout to reflect changes in Silva 2.1 as stable
  version, and 2.2 as development: SilvaLayout is not shipped anymore
  as an extra distribution but integrated in Silva all. Remove
  question, and update buildout.cfg template.
  [thefunny]

2.8 - July 31, 2008
-------------------

* Generate logrotate configuration file using collective.recipe.template
  so it does not need to contain absolute paths. This makes it possible
  to move the generated buildout around, or install it on other machines
  with different filesystem layouts.
  [wichert]

* Also rotate instance1-Z2.log.
  [wichert]

* Update documentation for hosting template to note that logrotate needs
  to be told where to put its status file.
  [wichert]


2.7 - July 25, 2008
-------------------

* Hosting template:

  - Switch default Plone version to 3.1.4.
    [wichert]

  - Corrected a typo in the logrotate template, which prevented the zeo log
    to be rotated.
    [hannosch]


2.6.2 - July 16, 2008
---------------------

* Hosting template:

  - Corrected even more references of instance to instance1 in proxy support
    and logrotate handling.
    [hannosch]


2.6.1 - July 16, 2008
---------------------

* Hosting template:

  - Changed the http_port to start at base_port + 10, to make room for
    additional services.
    [hannosch]

  - Corrected hide_summary option, to not show the summary twice.
    [hannosch]

2.6 - July 15, 2008
-------------------

* Hosting template:

  - Corrected one last reference of instance to instance1 in the zopepy eggs
    option of the plone_hosting template.
    [hannosch]

2.5 - July 15, 2008
-------------------

* Hosting template:

  - fix test for Varnish-support in the supervisord configuration.
    [wichert]

  - Rename the instance part to instance1 and add an instances group. This
    makes it possible to upgrade to multiple instances later on without
    having to break invocations.
    [wichert]

2.4 - July 9, 2008
------------------

* Restore the cwd after running buildout in the hosting recipe so further
  processing works correctly.
  [wichert]

* Add a hook in the hosting template to not show the summary. This
  can be used by derived templates that want to show their own summary
  or show it at a later point.
  [wichert]

* Set default Plone version to 3.1.3.
  [wichert]

* Added kss plugin template
  [gotcha, jfroche, adrien01]

* Silva layout have been merged with Silva all in the development
  buildout.
  [thefunny]

2.3 - June 24, 2008
-------------------

* Fix problem in the hosting template: varnish was always enabled
  even if not desired.
  [wichert]

* Added ZopeSkel test layer with the apropriate testSetup and testTearDown.
  The steps in the top of each test file is not anymore needed: delete
  tempdir/plone.example and then cd to tempdir.
  [mustapha]

* Make the zope2product option in the archetype template default to true.
  [mustapha]

* Modified buildout.cf to only test zopeskel.
  [mustapha]

* Fixed the paster test function: overwrite option should default to True for
  the create command.
  [mustapha]

* Added ``use_local_commands`` attribute (a la use_cheetah). A zopeskel
  template that wants to use local commands has to set it to True .
  [mustapha]

* Get rid of zopeskel.txt and use setup.cfg to store the parent template name.
  [mustapha]

* Sub-templates may define a parent_template attribute with the list of
  templates that can use it.
  [mustapha]

* Fixed tests and updated docs.
  [mustapha]

Version 2.2
-----------

* Install Plone 3.1.2 by default.
  [wichert]

* Remove useless spans from the portlet template.
  [wichert]

* Add supervisorctl configuration.
  [wichert]


Version 2.1
-----------

* Revert BaseTemplate usage from the hosting template (changeset
  57368 from Tarek). It was not used and broke the buildout. This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/8
  [wichert]

* Replace the generic README in the plone_hosting template with documentation
  that is important for deployments.
  [wichert]

* Add log rotation support to the hosting buildout. Merged from Jarn's
  bones package.
  [wichert]


Version 2.0
-----------

* Switch plone_hosting template to using supervisord to manage processes.
  Merged from Jarn's bones package.
  [wichert]

* Reduced the number of questions to generate an atschema and used
  the MessageFactory instead of declaring an i18n_domain attribute
  [mustapha]

* Fixed missing imports in plone2_theme
  [mustapha]

* Removed unused imports in plone_pas
  [mustapha]

* In plone2.5_theme: when the skinname is empty, replace it with a
  default text, otherwise adding a Plone Site will throw an error when
  displaying the extension profiles.
  [maurits]

* Added note to profiles.zcml of plone2.5_theme that
  five.registerPackage needs Five version 1.4.
  [maurits]

* Added a BUILDBOT.txt file.
  [tarek]

* plone3_portlet: added commented out alternative AddForm for when
  there are no configurable parameters.  That was shorter than listing
  all the changes (where we forgot one).
  [maurits]

* Fixed typos in archetyps and plone3 portlets: 'portletBotomLeft'
  should have been 'portletBottomLeft' with two 't's.
  [maurits]

* Made plone3_portlet respect pep8 (and pyflakes).
  [maurits]

* Use 1.0 as default version number for all templates. This is a more sensible
  default than 0.1 since we start of with dev-versions anyway.
  [wichert]

* sub-templates per ZopeSkel template: Only sub-templates related to the parent
  template is visible with the -l option
  [mustapha]

* added -a (--list-all) option to show all subtemplates regardless of the
  current project. Subtemplates that are not for the type of the current
  project are prefixed with N
  [mustapha]

* Fixed the recreation of the paster_plugins.txt metadata file for archetype.
  For now we have to run 2 times the egg_info command to get the paster_plugins
  file recreated (setuptools problem: nice task to fix)
  [mustapha]

* fixed the case of many inner packages: ask the user to choose a packe to
  inject content into if the command is run outside of an inner package
  [mustapha]

* make all ZopeSkel templates that inherits from BaseTemplate addcontent aware
  [mustapha]

* Added plone_pas template for PlonePas projects and many subtemplates
  [mustapha]

* regrouped archetype subtemplates in templates/archetype
  [mustapha]

* added and fixed tests
  [mustapha]


Version 1.10
------------

* Install Plone 3.1.1 as default option.
  [wichert]

* Fixed a problem with ZopeSkel localcommands when we have multiple
  projects, it was getting the first directory always and sometimes
  the package dir was not the first directory, so when running the
  addcontent in the package it was creating the contents in the wrong
  dir. Thanks to wichert for pointing me this file.
  [dsa]

* Update the hosting template to make running of buildout optional.
  [wichert]

* Update the hosting template to test if a port is already in use and
  abort if so.
  [wichert]

* Update the hosting template to only ask for a single base port number.
  [wichert]

* Fix broken creation of Plone 3.1(.x) sites.
  [wichert]


Version 1.9
-----------

* Install Plone 3.1 as default option.
  [wichert]

* Fixed a missing 'import os' in the plone2_theme template. [davisagli]

* Fix an ambiguous question in the silva_buildout template, and update
  the generated README file. [thefunny]


Version 1.8
-----------

* fixed the recipe template buildout.cfg generation, thanks Kai ;)
  [tarek]

Version 1.7
-----------

* Update the templates to have README.txt and HISTORY.txt in valid
  restructured format and use those as the package's long description.
  This automatically gives packages a more readable page on PyPI
  (and PSC with Tarek's excellent changes).
  [wichert]

* Adjust the trove classifiers on the packages to not claim incorrect
  frameworks: we should only claim frameworks on which the package
  can run directly. So, for example, do not claim Zope2 of we also need
  Plone on top of Zope2.
  [wichert]


Version 1.6
-----------

* Add templates for a Silva buildout.
  [thefunny]

* Add a metadata.xml to all generated GenericSetup profiles. This is
  required by new versions of GenericSetup.
  [wichert]

* For nested namespace packages we need to declare both namespace
  levels as namespace packages. This is a requirement for current
  versions of setuptools.
  [wichert]

* Use Plone 3.0.6 as default version for new Plone hosting buildouts
  [wichert]


Version 1.5.1
-------------

* Fix #2 (missing import in 'hosting.py') at
  http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/2
  [nouri]

Version 1.5
-----------

* added a new local command into archetype template to inject
  new content types [spanky]

* added a doctest for each template, and refactored the package
  so we have one python module per template [tarek]

* Refactored the zc.buildout recipe to provide structured documention
  that will render nicely on PyPI, added comments for recipe authors
  to help writing documentation and tests and added a working doctest
  skeleton. Implemented automatic license classifiers for common
  licenses in the generated setup.py. The mapping is in zopeskel.base
  and can be used for other templates also.
  [dokai]

* The 'five:registerPackage' ZCML directive is added in a project based on the
  'plone' template only if the top level namespace package is not
  called 'Products'. This avoids having the product loaded twice in Zope.
  [davconvent]

* Added paragraph about old style Zope 2 Product installation in the
  INSTALL.txt_tmpl file of the plone template.
  The paragraph will be added to the installation instructions if the top
  level namespace package is called 'Products'.
  [davconvent]

Version 1.4
-----------

* Set the version number for plone.recipe.plone in a new versions part in
  buildout.cfg. That works around a buildout bug: buildout breaks if you change
  the revision pin for a recipe.
  [wichert]

* Fixed bug: when running 'paster create' with --no-interactive option,
  the package variable given in the command line is ignored.
  [Mustapha]

Version 1.3.4
-------------

* Added MANIFEST.in to prevent bad releases from svn exports.
  [fschulze]

Version 1.3.3
-------------

* Move to the newly released Varnish 1.1.2.
  [wichert]

* Remove bad import which broke localcommand support.
  [deo]

* Remove unneeded imports and whitespace cleanup.
  [deo]

Version 1.3.2
-------------

* Small fix in plone3_theme that did not install correctly with easy_install
  because of some files missing the the egg informations (added MANIFEST.in).
  [davconvent]

Version 1.3.1
-------------

* Added 'addcontent' local command to make possible injecting content types
  in ZopeSkel projects and make the Archetype template 'addcontent' aware.
  [mustapha]

* Updated to Plone 3.0.4.
  [fschulze]

* Rerelease because of a bad egg.
  [fschulze]

Version 1.3
-----------

* added the `recipe` template
  [tarek]

* Add Plone 2.5.5.
  [wichert]

Version 1.2
-----------

* Merge a slightly stripped down version of the Jarn Plone hosting template.
  This provides a convenient way to create a buildout for all Plone 2.5 and
  3.0 versions with ZEO and optional Varnish based caching.
  [wichert]
